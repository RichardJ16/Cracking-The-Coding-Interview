Q1_1Naive: Brute force check.

Q1_1Hash: Dictionary maps indices to the characters(keys). Thus, if the string does not contain all unique characters 
	then the length of the keys will be less than the length of the string.

Q1_2: Sort the strings and then perform a string comparison

Q1_3: Checks if the current index is a space. If it is, then it sets it to %20 and appends to our return string.

Q1_4: Similar to Q1_1Hash. Map indices to keys and then take the length of the indices at each key. If the key has an odd
	number of values we add 1 to the counter and if this counter is not 0 or 1 then it can not be a palindrome.
